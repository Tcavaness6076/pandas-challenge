## Overview
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook we created a high-level snapshot of the Total Number of Unique Schools, Total Students, Total Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, Percent Passing Math, Percent Passing Reading and Overall Percent Passing(Passing Math and Reading) for the disctrict. Then we created a dataframe that displayed the School Name, School Type, Total Students, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, Percent Passing Math, Percent Passing Reading and Overall Percent Passing for each School. In that data frame we displayed the Five Highest and Lowest Scoring Schools based on "Overall Passing". We seperated our Math and Reading scores based on each grade (9th, 10th, 11th and 12th) and finally using bins we sperated Schools into Scores based on School Spending and another binning of Scores based on School Size.
